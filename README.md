# CHAPTER-8-PORTFOLIO

Creating effective navigation in an app is essential for guiding users through different screens and features. In Flutter, navigation can be managed using various methods like stack-based navigation, where screens are pushed and popped from a stack, or Drawer navigation, which offers a sliding panel from the side to access different sections. Additionally, Bottom Navigation Bars provide quick access to primary sections, and Named Routes allow developers to centrally define and manage navigation, making it scalable for larger apps. Good navigation ensures a smooth user experience, helping users intuitively move through the app, enhancing usability and engagement.
